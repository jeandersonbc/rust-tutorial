Getting started with Rust!

After reading a post from the Mozilla Firefox team about migrating some
of the core functionalities from C/C++ to Rust, I got curious and excited about
having some hands-on with Rust :-)

Please, join with me! Visit [The Rust Programming Language book
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/) and try yourself some Rust :-)
